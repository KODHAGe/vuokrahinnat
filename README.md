# vuokrahinnat

A cool project, that is very nice. All the ugly stuff is just due to sheer speed of development. 
Move fast and break things, amirite :)

R <3 JS

You'll need a Google API to run the R-stuff, so get one here: https://console.cloud.google.com/

The web-application itself is not dependant on the R-things, and resides in web/. It can be run locally by npm start. 
The leaflet map on the other hand is generated directly from R, and needs to be deployed/run separately.

Map runs on surge at http://zesty-walk.surge.sh/
and the site at http://vuokrahinnat.surge.sh/
